# Feature Specification: AutoDoc ‚Äî Intelligent Automated Documentation Partner

**Feature Branch**: `[001-build-the-autodoc]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description:

> Build the AutoDoc app that is designed to be an intelligent, automated documentation partner for software development teams. At its core, it addresses the common and persistent challenge of keeping code documentation current, comprehensive, and truly useful.
> AutoDoc automates this entire discovery process. It clones a code repository and performs a deep analysis of the source code. It doesn't just look at comments; it uses AI to understand the relationships between files, functions, classes, and modules.
> From this analysis, it generates a complete wiki. This isn't just a collection of text files. It includes:
> - Structural Documentation: Clear explanations of the project's architecture and how the pieces fit together.
> - Visual Diagrams: It automatically creates diagrams (using the Mermaid syntax) that visually map out the code structure, making complex systems much easier to comprehend at a glance.
> - Merge back to the repo: Autodoc creates a pull request back to the code base with the updated documents.
> - Conversational AI: Perhaps its most powerful feature is an integrated chat that allows you to "ask questions" to the codebase. You can ask things like, "What's the process for user authentication?" or "Where is the database logic handled?" and the system will provide answers based on its understanding of the code.
> AutoDoc aims to make codebases more transparent and accessible, which speeds up developer onboarding, simplifies maintenance, and empowers developers to contribute more effectively without getting lost in the code.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I connect my repository to AutoDoc and trigger an analysis. AutoDoc clones the repo, performs deep code comprehension, and generates a clear, navigable wiki with structural documentation and visual diagrams. AutoDoc opens a pull request with the new/updated documentation. I can then ask conversational questions about the codebase (e.g., authentication flow, database logic) and receive accurate answers with source citations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a public GitHub repository URL, **When** I request analysis, **Then** AutoDoc clones the default branch, analyzes the code, and produces a documentation wiki with at least one structural overview page and a Mermaid diagram within performance targets.
2. **Given** a generated wiki, **When** AutoDoc completes analysis, **Then** a pull request is opened in the repository containing all new/updated documentation artifacts with proper provenance metadata.
3. **Given** the conversational interface, **When** I ask "Where is the database logic handled?", **Then** AutoDoc returns a streaming answer within 1500ms that includes citations with file paths and commit SHAs and offers direct links to open those files in the repo.
4. **Given** a repository update on the default branch, **When** changes are detected, **Then** the wiki is updated within 10 minutes and a follow-up PR is created if content changes are detected.
5. **Given** a large monorepo, **When** analysis runs, **Then** the output remains responsive and structured (module-level pages and diagrams) with progress indicators, and chat answers include correct citations with sub-1500ms first token latency.
6. **Given** a user with accessibility needs, **When** they navigate the interface using keyboard-only or screen reader, **Then** all functionality is accessible with proper ARIA labels and contrast ratios meeting WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
7. **Given** multiple concurrent users analyzing different repositories, **When** the system is under load, **Then** performance targets are maintained and no private repository content is exposed to unauthorized users.

### Edge Cases
- Very large repositories or monorepos with multiple packages requiring performance optimization.
- Private repositories requiring permissions and minimal OAuth scopes with proper security enforcement.
- Binary-heavy or generated-code-dominant repositories with little source commentary.
- Repositories with multiple primary languages and frameworks requiring comprehensive analysis.
- Repositories lacking a conventional entry point or with unconventional layouts.
- Rate-limited provider APIs during cloning or PR creation requiring proper retry logic.
- High-traffic scenarios with multiple concurrent analyses requiring performance maintenance.
- Accessibility edge cases including screen readers, high-contrast modes, and keyboard-only navigation.
- Network failures or partial outages requiring graceful degradation and clear error messaging.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to connect a repository via direct URL and/or provider integration (GitHub, Bitbucket).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST clone the repository in read-only fashion and analyze the default branch by default, with the ability to target a specific branch or commit.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST perform deep static analysis to identify files, functions, classes, modules, and their relationships.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate a navigable documentation wiki that explains architecture, module responsibilities, and how components fit together.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST generate visual diagrams using Mermaid syntax that map key relationships (e.g., module dependency graphs, call graphs where feasible).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST create a pull request to the source repository containing the generated/updated documentation artifacts in a clearly defined documentation location.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a conversational interface to query the codebase and return answers grounded in code understanding.
- **FR-008**: Answers from the conversational interface MUST include citations (file path, repository, commit SHA) and links back to source.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST re-analyze and update documentation when the repository changes, meeting the constitution's freshness targets for default-branch updates.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle errors with clear user-facing messages and designed empty/loading/error states.

*Ambiguities to clarify:*
- **FR-011**: The system MUST support public repository access via URL only for v1; OAuth and personal access token authentication are out of scope.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST generate a single documentation file located in the `/docs/` directory of the repository and persist the documentation in the AutoDoc database for queries.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST support both GitHub and Bitbucket as repository providers at launch.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST support analysis of most programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, etc.) and treat non-programming file types as text files for inclusion in the analysis.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST create pull requests targeting the default branch with standardized titles ("docs: Update AutoDoc analysis") and descriptions that include analysis summary, timestamp, and commit SHA of the analyzed branch.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST generate diagrams without predefined limits on depth or size, dynamically adapting layout and grouping to maintain readability regardless of codebase complexity.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST support unlimited chat conversations per repository with no artificial response length limits, and MUST store conversation history only for the current session without persistence across browser sessions or user accounts.

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: The system MUST meet UI interaction targets of p50 ‚â§ 500ms and p95 ‚â§ 1500ms for all user actions.
- **PR-002**: Chat responses MUST begin streaming within 1500ms at p95 latency.
- **PR-003**: Repository analysis MUST complete within reasonable time bounds appropriate to repository size, with progress indicators for long-running operations.
- **PR-004**: The system MUST handle repository updates and reflect changes within 10 minutes for 95% of default-branch updates, with a hard cap of 30 minutes.

### Accessibility & UX Requirements
- **UX-001**: The system MUST meet WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards.
- **UX-002**: The system MUST support keyboard-first navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **UX-003**: The system MUST provide consistent theming (light/dark modes, high-contrast options).
- **UX-004**: The system MUST include designed empty states, loading states, and error states for all user interactions.
- **UX-005**: All content referencing code MUST include clear provenance (repository, file path, commit SHA) with direct links to source.

### Security & Privacy Requirements
- **SEC-001**: The system MUST enforce least-privilege access patterns for repository integrations.
- **SEC-002**: The system MUST never expose private repository content to unauthorized users.
- **SEC-003**: The system MUST keep authentication tokens out of logs and implement proper secrets management.
- **SEC-004**: Conversation logs MUST be redacted of secrets by default, with explicit user consent required for any retention.

### Environment & Deployment Requirements
