# Tasks: AutoDoc — Intelligent Automated Documentation Partner

**Input**: Design documents from `E:/projects/autodoc/autodoc-v2/specs/001-build-the-autodoc/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, LangGraph agents
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- MongoDB vector search replaces ChromaDB
- Python 3.12+ required for async/await patterns
- All API responses must include proper error handling
- Webhook signatures must be validated for security

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - repository_api.yaml → T007 (contract test)
   - documentation_api.yaml → T008 (contract test)
   - chat_api.yaml → T009 (contract test)
   - webhook endpoints → T010 (contract test)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Repository → T017 (model creation)
   - CodeDocument → T018 (model creation)
   - Wiki entities → T019 (model creation)
   - Chat entities → T020 (model creation)
   - Config entities → T021 (model creation)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Repository registration → T011 (integration test)
   - Document analysis → T012 (integration test)
   - Wiki generation → T013 (integration test)
   - Chat workflow → T014 (integration test)
   - Webhook processing → T015 (integration test)
   - Semantic search → T016 (integration test)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Agents → API → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
