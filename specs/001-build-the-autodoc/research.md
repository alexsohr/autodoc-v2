# Research: AutoDoc v2 Architecture & Technology Decisions

## Framework Architecture Decision

**Decision**: LangGraph + LangChain + FastAPI
**Rationale**: 
- LangGraph provides stateful workflow orchestration for complex multi-step AI processing
- LangChain offers robust document loading, text splitting, and LLM provider abstraction
- FastAPI delivers high-performance async APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic ensures type safety and validation throughout the system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom workflow engine: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead
- Celery + Redis: Rejected as LangGraph provides better AI workflow primitives
- Django REST: Rejected due to sync nature and heavier framework overhead

## Storage Strategy Decision

**Decision**: Environment-adaptive storage with abstraction layer
**Rationale**:
- Development simplicity with local filesystem and MongoDB
- Production scalability with AWS S3 and MongoDB
- Storage adapter pattern enables easy environment switching
- Consistent database technology (MongoDB) across environments
- MongoDB vector search eliminates need for separate vector database

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single storage solution: Rejected as dev/prod needs differ for file storage
- Multiple databases in production: Rejected for operational complexity
- ChromaDB for vectors: Rejected in favor of MongoDB vector search for consistency

## LLM Provider Integration Decision

**Decision**: Provider-agnostic JSON configuration
**Rationale**:
- Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Ollama)
- Configuration-driven provider switching without code changes
- Cost optimization through provider selection
- Vendor lock-in avoidance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single provider (OpenAI): Rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- Runtime provider switching: Rejected due to complexity
- Multiple simultaneous providers: Rejected for initial version scope

## Workflow Orchestration Decision

**Decision**: LangGraph state-based workflows
**Rationale**:
- Built-in state management for complex AI workflows
- Retry and error handling primitives
- Visual workflow representation
- Integration with LangChain ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- Apache Airflow: Rejected as overkill for AI-specific workflows
- Custom state machine: Rejected due to development overhead
- Sequential processing: Rejected due to lack of error recovery

## Vector Database Decision

**Decision**: MongoDB vector search for both environments
**Rationale**:
- Consistent database technology across development and production
- MongoDB Atlas Vector Search provides production-ready capabilities
- Eliminates need for separate vector database management
- Native integration with existing MongoDB operations
- Simplified development setup with single database

**Alternatives considered**:
- ChromaDB: Rejected in favor of MongoDB consistency across environments
- Pinecone: Rejected due to cost and external dependency
- Weaviate: Rejected due to operational complexity

## Authentication Strategy Decision

**Decision**: Environment-specific auth with AWS IAM for production
**Rationale**:
- Simple development setup with basic auth or none
- Enterprise-ready with AWS IAM integration
- Role-based access control for repository permissions
- Scalable multi-tenant architecture

**Alternatives considered**:
- OAuth only: Rejected as overly complex for development
- API keys only: Rejected due to limited permission granularity
- Custom auth system: Rejected due to security complexity

## Repository Processing Decision

**Decision**: Async processing with LangGraph workflows
**Rationale**:
- Non-blocking repository cloning and analysis
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Scalable concurrent processing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Rejected due to timeout issues
- Background job queues: Rejected as LangGraph provides better primitives
- Streaming processing: Rejected as too complex for initial version

## API Design Decision

**Decision**: REST API with streaming support for chat
**Rationale**:
- Standard REST for repository operations
- Server-sent events for streaming chat responses
- OpenAPI documentation generation
- Easy client integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- GraphQL: Rejected due to complexity for this use case
- WebSocket: Rejected as SSE sufficient for streaming
- gRPC: Rejected due to client complexity

## Deployment Strategy Decision

**Decision**: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Docker
**Rationale**:
- Fine-grained control over container orchestration
- Excellent integration with AWS services (S3, IAM, Parameter Store)
- Cost-effective compared to Kubernetes managed services
- Built-in service discovery and load balancing
- Supports both Fargate (serverless) and EC2 launch types
- Docker ensures consistent environments across dev/prod

**Alternatives considered**:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Rejected due to less container-native features
- Amazon EKS (Kubernetes): Rejected due to operational complexity and cost
- Lambda functions: Rejected due to execution time limits for analysis workflows
- EC2 instances: Rejected due to management overhead

## Performance Optimization Decision

**Decision**: Multi-level caching with Redis/ElastiCache
**Rationale**:
- Repository metadata caching for quick access
- Embedding caching to avoid recomputation
- Query result caching for common questions
- Stale-while-revalidate patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory caching only: Rejected due to loss on restart
- Database-only caching: Rejected due to performance limitations
- No caching: Rejected due to performance requirements
